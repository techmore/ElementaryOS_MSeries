# OS 9 implementation / Claude Code handoff

Updated 2026-10-13. Repository: techmore/ElementaryOS_MSeries.

## Source verified

The official public elementary/os repository was cloned to
/tmp/elementary-os9-public-source. Its main HEAD is
7024fd04646a6a8565bf6805989b59fd72de928c, already merged into this port.
OS 9 is developed on main, not a 9.0 branch. No sponsor-only source or
Early Access binary was used. Component source/licensing still needs
per-component review before importing new patches.

## First implementation

- Replaced the fork's scheduled release workflow (which needed upstream
  signing/R2 secrets) with a manual arm64 build. It uploads an experimental
  ISO, checksum, commit record, and build logs to GitHub Actions artifacts.
  Failed builds retain logs. No official release is published.
- Fixed an image-layer dependency gap: apple-silicon/mkosi.finalize deletes
  package payloads; ExtraTrees cannot resolve apt dependencies. The liveiso
  and sysupdate arm64 configs now explicitly install pipewire-pulse,
  pipewire-alsa, rtkit, and python3-gi.
- Added test-image-wiring.py to catch lost runtime packages in either consumer.
- Fixed finalize deleting the brightness helper and its Pantheon autostart
  entry. A temporary-image cleanup test verifies all shipped helper files
  survive while package payloads are pruned.
- Completed the pending audit/status-page edits and specific bug-fix roadmap.

## Next tasks, in order

Coordination: Codex handles implementation and review; OpenCode handles
build preflight/log analysis using its configured provider (explicitly
approved by the owner). Claude Code can take over from this file. All
agents must document commands, outcomes, blockers, and next steps; commit
and push completed batches. Coordinate Git writes through one agent at a
time. OpenCode's assigned preflight writes only OPENCODE-BUILD-REPORT.md;
Codex reviews and commits its report alongside the implementation.

Model preference recorded from the owner: use Muse 1.3 for OpenCode build
work (`opencode/muse-spark-1.3` is listed as available); DeepSeek 4.1
(`opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash`) is another preferred option. The initial
preflight used the configured default `opencode/cat-jam-free` before this
preference was supplied. Do not silently claim that run used Muse.

Model-selection references supplied by the owner:
- https://opencode.ai/data/ — usage/session-cost data; assess task results too.
- https://anoma.ly/notes/opencode-2-0/ — service/API and background-task design.
- Owner flagged DeepSeek V4.1 usage credits and a one-week Step 5 Preview
  promotion announced October 8. Verify current eligibility/expiry before
  assuming free use or credits. Step's listed model ID is
  `opencode/step-5-preview-free`.

## GitHub progress

Implementation pushed as 39fd815; reviewed preflight/dependencies pushed as
401dad7. GitHub Pages deployment for 401dad7 succeeded.
The first manual runs were started at 401dad7:
- Experimental arm64 build: https://github.com/techmore/ElementaryOS_MSeries/actions/runs/38396499561
- Validation: https://github.com/techmore/ElementaryOS_MSeries/actions/runs/38396503055

Validation completed successfully, including mkosi config parsing. The
experimental build was still in progress at handoff recording. Inspect its
actual conclusion and retained logs before claiming success; do not launch
duplicates.

Final OpenCode review used `opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free`, as
requested. It inspected the corrected finalize allowlist, both arm64
consumer configs, workflow, and regression tests; both tests passed and
it reported no new blocker in that scope. No ISO was built by the reviewer.

1. Run the manual OS 9 M-series experimental build after these changes reach
   GitHub. Inspect retained build logs; resolve actual package/module/config
   errors before attempting hardware installation. A source/config test is
   not evidence of a successful ISO build.
2. Package the tested Ubuntu speaker chain into the image. Ubuntu supplies
   speakersafetyd/asahi-audio/alsa-ucm-conf-asahi, but its PipeWire build lacks
   the LV2 filter plugin. Build the plugin against the exact image PipeWire
   version and package it reproducibly before enabling DSP. See
   install-pipewire-lv2.sh and install-audio-stack.sh. Do not expose raw
   internal speakers as a fallback or bypass speakersafetyd.
3. Qualify an Asahi kernel and boot path for the factory image. The working
   host uses a custom fairydust kernel; Ubuntu generic is unverified. Do not
   alter this host's bootloader or install an experimental kernel to it.
4. Audit public OS 9 component changes (Gala, Wingpanel, Granite, settings)
   against installed package versions; choose reproducible fixes, not blanket
   desktop upgrades. Record source commits and licenses for each import.
5. Keep omacom/omarchy-mac-pkgs as the Apple hardware behavior reference at
   222f7a8599bbdd287ac6a95362cd51c5b024baae. Translate Arch behavior to
   Ubuntu/Pantheon. Its package repository was not modified by this work.

## Preserve unrelated work

These pre-existing untracked Gala drafts were not changed or committed:
- mseries/gala-daemon-fix/build.py
- mseries/install-gala-osk-fix.sh
- mseries/patches/gala-disabled-osk-input-purpose.patch

Inspect and reproduce the reported OSK issue before incorporating them.

## Verification

Run python3 mseries/test-image-wiring.py and git diff --check.
CI also parses all mkosi configs with just mkosi summary. This workstation
has neither just nor podman available, so full mkosi parsing/building must
run in CI or a prepared build environment. No ISO or hardware qualification
is claimed. This handoff supports manual takeover by Claude Code; it does
not install a timer or automatic agent switch.
